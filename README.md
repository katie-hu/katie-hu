# Welcome!

Hi Everyone! My name is Katie Hu.
Thank you for stopping by my page! I'm currently working in the defense industry as a data engineer/data scientist.
My focus is in HR-related data. In addition, I'm pursuing my master's degree in applied data science and expected to complete the program August 2023. Most of my content is in **Python** and **R**. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
