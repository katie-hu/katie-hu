My name is Katie Hu. Thank you for stopping by my page! 
I'm currently working in the defense industry as a data engineer/data scientist with a focus in HR-related data. 
In addition, I'm pursuing my master's degree in applied data science and expected to complete the program August 2023. 
Most of my content is in **Python** and **R**. 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
